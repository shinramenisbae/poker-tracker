# Tribe Poker Tracker

A full-stack web application for tracking home poker game sessions. Manages player buy-ins, rebuys, cash-outs, and automatic settlement calculations.

Built with React + TypeScript on the frontend and Express.js + SQLite on the backend.

## Features

- **Quick Buy-In Buttons** — Predefined $50 and $100 buy-in buttons, plus custom amounts
- **Automatic Settlement** — Calculates who owes whom at the end of a session, splitting across cash and bank transfers

- **Statistics & Leaderboard** — Lifetime player stats, biggest wins/losses, session history, and a global leaderboard
- **Multi-Currency Support** — USD, EUR, GBP, and NZD
- **Common Players** — Quick-add buttons for frequently playing members

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shinramenisbae/poker-tracker.git
cd poker-tracker

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../app
npm install
```

### Running Locally

Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev    # Runs with nodemon on port 5001
```

In a separate terminal, start the frontend dev server:

```bash
cd app
npm run dev    # Runs Vite dev server
```

### Building for Production

```bash
cd app
npm run build  # Outputs to app/dist/
```

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are served from port `5001` under the `/api` prefix.

### Sessions

| Method | Endpoint            | Description                         |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/sessions`     | List all sessions (newest first)    |
| GET    | `/api/sessions/:id` | Get a single session                |
| POST   | `/api/sessions`     | Create a new session                |
| PUT    | `/api/sessions/:id` | Update session (status, notes, etc) |
| DELETE | `/api/sessions/:id` | Delete a session                    |

### Players & Buy-ins

| Method | Endpoint                                        | Description          |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| POST   | `/api/sessions/:id/players`                     | Add player to session|
| POST   | `/api/sessions/:id/players/:playerId/buyins`    | Record a buy-in      |
| PUT    | `/api/sessions/:id/players/:playerId/cashout`   | Record a cash-out    |

All mutation endpoints return the full updated session object with nested players and buy-ins.

## Database Schema

Three SQLite tables with foreign key cascading deletes:

- **sessions** — `id`, `date`, `status` (active/completed), `notes`, `bankPlayerId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- **players** — `id`, `sessionId`, `name`, `paymentMethod`, `cashOutAmount`, `cashOutDate`
- **buyIns** — `id`, `playerId`, `amount`, `timestamp`, `isRebuy`, `method` (cash/bank)

## Settlement Logic

When a session ends, the app calculates settlements:

1. Identifies the **bank player** (biggest winner)
2. Separates buy-ins into **cash pool** (physical cash on table) and **bank transfers**
3. Winners receive proportional shares of the cash pool; any remaining amount owed is settled via bank transfer from the bank player
4. Losers with negative `netWithBank` owe bank transfers to the bank player
5. The results page shows a clear breakdown of who pays whom and by what method

## Deployment

The included `deploy.sh` script builds the frontend, copies it to `/var/www/poker-tracker/`, and restarts the systemd services:

- `poker-tracker.service` — serves the frontend (port 5000)
- `tribe-poker-backend.service` — runs the API server (port 5001)

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

## App Pages

- **Home** (`/`) — View active and completed sessions, create new ones
- **New Session** (`/session/new`) — Set date, add notes, pick players from common list or type new names
- **Session Detail** (`/session/:id`) — Live session management: buy-ins, rebuys, cash-outs
- **Results** (`/session/:id/results`) — Post-session settlements, winners/losers breakdown
- **Stats** (`/stats`) — Lifetime leaderboard, per-player stats, biggest wins/losses
- **Settings** (`/settings`) — Currency, default buy-in amount, common players list
